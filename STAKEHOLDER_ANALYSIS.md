### Stakeholder Roles and Context

1. **Customers**: Customers are the end-users who purchase products from Spaza shops. Their primary concern is to have access to safe and authentic products. They play a crucial role in the system by using it to scan and verify the authenticity of products before making a purchase. This helps reduce the risk of buying counterfeit or expired products, contributing to their overall satisfaction and safety.

2. **Manufacturers**: Manufacturers create QR codes for product packages and supply authentic products to the market. They are concerned with protecting their brand integrity and ensuring that their products are not counterfeited. Counterfeit products can damage their reputation and result in financial losses.

3. **Shop Owners**: Shop owners manage the inventory and sales of products in Spaza shops. They scan QR codes to verify the authenticity of products, register products in the store, and monitor expired products. The inability to verify product authenticity is a significant pain point for them.

4. **Regulators**: Regulators are responsible for ensuring that Spaza shops comply with health and safety standards. They monitor compliance of stores and manufacturers, and use the system to verify if a store is registered. Enforcement of regulations to prevent the sale of counterfeit products is a key concern, but they often face challenges due to insufficient resources for monitoring and enforcement.

5. **Developers**: Developers are tasked with developing and maintaining the product verification system. They need to ensure that the system is reliable, secure, and easy to integrate with existing infrastructure. Complexity in system integration and maintenance is a common challenge they face.

6. **Community Leaders**: Community leaders advocate for the health and safety of their communities. They aim to improve overall community health by raising awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products. However, they often struggle with a lack of resources to educate the community effectively.

7. **Environmental Health Professionals**: These professionals monitor and ensure public health safety by identifying and removing counterfeit and expired products from the market. They face challenges in tracking the sources of counterfeit products and ensuring they are promptly removed from circulation.
