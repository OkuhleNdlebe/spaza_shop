# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual tool used in Agile project management to track and manage tasks as they move through different stages of a workflow. It typically consists of columns that represent various phases of the work process, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Tasks are represented as cards that move from one column to another as they progress.

## How My Board Visualizes Workflow
My customized Kanban board visualizes the workflow by using the following columns:
- **To Do**: This column contains tasks that are ready to be picked up and worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on are placed in this column.
- **In Review**: Tasks that have been completed and are awaiting review are moved to this column.
- **Testing**: Tasks that are undergoing quality assurance testing are placed here.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that are currently blocked due to dependencies or other issues are moved to this column.
- **Done**: Completed tasks are placed in this column.

By moving tasks from one column to another, team members can easily see the current status of each task and understand the overall progress of the project.

## Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
To avoid bottlenecks and ensure focused work, my Kanban board limits the number of tasks that can be in each column at any given time. For example:
- **In Progress**: A maximum of 3 tasks can be in this column simultaneously.
- **In Review**: A maximum of 2 tasks can be in this column at any time.
- **Testing**: A maximum of 2 tasks can be in this column at any time.

By limiting WIP, I ensure that team members are not overwhelmed with too many tasks and can focus on completing tasks efficiently. This also helps in identifying and addressing bottlenecks early.

## Supporting Agile Principles
My Kanban board supports Agile principles in the following ways:
- **Continuous Delivery**: By visualizing the workflow and limiting WIP, the board helps the team deliver tasks continuously and incrementally. This aligns with the Agile principle of delivering working software frequently.
- **Adaptability**: The board allows for easy adaptation to changes in priorities or requirements. Tasks can be reprioritized and moved between columns as needed, ensuring that the team remains flexible and responsive to changes.
- **Transparency**: The visual nature of the Kanban board provides transparency into the status of tasks and overall project progress. Team members and stakeholders can easily see what is being worked on, what is completed, and where there might be issues.
- **Collaboration**: The board fosters collaboration among team members by providing a shared view of the project. Team members can communicate about task statuses, blockers, and priorities, ensuring that everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.

By utilizing a Kanban board, I can effectively manage tasks, ensure continuous delivery, and maintain adaptability and transparency in the project management process.
