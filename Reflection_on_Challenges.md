# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Balancing the diverse needs of stakeholders in this project presented several challenges:

## Conflicting Priorities
Different stakeholders had varying priorities. For example:
- **Customers** prioritized having a user-friendly interface to quickly verify product authenticity.
- **Shop Owners** focused on efficient inventory management and product expiry monitoring.
- **Regulators** needed comprehensive compliance monitoring and reporting capabilities.

Balancing these conflicting priorities required careful consideration and compromise to ensure that the system effectively addressed the most critical needs of each group.

## Resource Constraints
Government authorities and environmental health professionals often face resource constraints, making it challenging to enforce regulations and monitor compliance effectively. Designing a system that provides maximum value with minimal resource input was essential to address this concern.

## Awareness and Education
Community leaders emphasized the need for awareness and education programs to inform residents about the dangers of counterfeit products. Reaching a wide audience with limited resources was challenging. Incorporating online educational resources and community programs into the system helped address this concern.

## Security and Privacy
Ensuring the security and privacy of user data, especially in compliance with GDPR and POPIA regulations, required robust security measures. Balancing ease of use with stringent security protocols was a delicate task. Implementing Laravel security measures, including CSRF protection, input validation, and secure password storage using bcrypt, helped mitigate these challenges.

## Scalability and Performance
The system needed to support a large number of concurrent users and provide quick responses to verification requests. Designing a scalable and high-performance system while maintaining cost-effectiveness was a significant challenge. Leveraging Google Cloud Platform's services and horizontal scaling capabilities helped address scalability and performance concerns.

## Integration and Maintenance
Developers faced challenges related to system integration and maintenance. Ensuring that the system is reliable, secure, and easy to integrate with existing infrastructure required careful planning and execution. Providing comprehensive documentation, including an API guide, supported future integrations and modular updates without downtime.

Overall, the process involved continuous stakeholder engagement, iterative development, and a focus on delivering a system that meets the critical needs of all stakeholders while addressing their key concerns and pain points.

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template

### Challenges in Selecting the Template
1. **Variety of Options**: GitHub offers multiple templates such as Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, Bug Triage, and Team Planning. Each template has its own set of features and workflows, making it challenging to choose the most suitable one for the project's needs.
2. **Feature Overlap**: Many templates have overlapping features, which can lead to confusion when trying to determine which template best aligns with Agile methodologies and project requirements.
3. **Limited Documentation**: While GitHub provides basic descriptions for each template, the documentation often lacks detailed explanations of how each template's features can be leveraged in different project contexts. This makes it difficult to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of each template.

### Challenges in Customizing the Template
1. **Column Customization**: Adding new columns to the existing templates was straightforward, but ensuring that these columns were effectively integrated into the workflow required careful planning. For example, introducing "Testing" and "Blocked" columns needed a clear definition of their roles and how tasks would transition between columns.
2. **Automation Complexity**: The Automated Kanban template includes built-in automation features, but customizing these automations to fit specific project needs was challenging. It required an understanding of GitHub Actions and workflows to automate task movements and assignments effectively.
3. **Integration with Existing Issues**: Linking existing GitHub issues to the new Kanban board and ensuring that all tasks were accurately represented and assigned involved manual effort. Ensuring that issues were correctly categorized and labeled added another layer of complexity.

## Comparison of GitHub's Templates to Other Tools

### Trello
- **Flexibility**: Trello offers highly flexible and customizable boards with drag-and-drop functionality. Users can create as many columns as needed and customize them with various labels, due dates, and checklists.
- **Power-Ups**: Trello's Power-Ups (integrations) allow users to add advanced features such as calendar views, custom fields, and automation rules. This makes it easy to extend Trello's functionality to fit specific project needs.
- **User Experience**: Trello's interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for new users to get started. The simplicity of Trello's design is one of its key strengths.

### Jira
- **Advanced Features**: Jira is known for its robust feature set, including advanced reporting, custom workflows, and deep integration with development tools like Bitbucket and Confluence. This makes it ideal for large and complex projects.
- **Customization**: Jira offers extensive customization options for workflows, issue types, and fields. Users can define detailed processes and enforce specific rules for task transitions.
- **Agile Support**: Jira is explicitly designed to support Agile methodologies, with built-in Scrum and Kanban boards, backlog management, and sprint planning tools. Its comprehensive Agile features make it a preferred choice for Agile teams.

### Comparison with GitHub
- **Integration with Code Repositories**: GitHub's Kanban boards are natively integrated with GitHub repositories, making it easy to link issues, pull requests, and commits directly to the board. This seamless integration is a significant advantage for development teams already using GitHub for version control.
- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: While Trello offers simplicity and ease of use, and Jira provides advanced features and customization, GitHub's templates strike a balance between the two. GitHub's boards are simpler than Jira's but offer more native integration with development workflows than Trello.
- **Automation**: GitHub's Automated Kanban template includes built-in automation features, similar to Trello's Power-Ups and Jira's automation rules. However, setting up and customizing these automations in GitHub can be more complex and may require familiarity with GitHub Actions.

## Conclusion
Selecting and customizing a Kanban board template on GitHub involved several challenges, including understanding the various options, integrating new columns, and leveraging automation features. Compared to other tools like Trello and Jira, GitHub's templates offer a balanced approach with native integration into development workflows, making them suitable for teams already using GitHub for version control. However, the complexity of customization and automation may require additional effort and expertise.
