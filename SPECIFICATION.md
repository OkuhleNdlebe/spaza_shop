# SpazaSafe: System Specification Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Title
**SpazaSafe: Counterfeit & Expired Product Detection System**

### 1.2 Domain
**Retail & Consumer Safety**  
SpazaSafe operates within the **informal retail sector**, specifically targeting Spaza shops in South Africa. It aims to ensure product authenticity and safety through a digital verification system.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
The proliferation of counterfeit and expired products in Spaza shops poses a serious health risk, particularly in low-income communities. Consumers, especially children, are vulnerable to unsafe goods, which can lead to severe health consequences, including fatal incidents. The lack of regulatory oversight and supply chain transparency allows fake products to infiltrate the market undetected.

SpazaSafe addresses this issue by introducing a **QR code-based verification system** that enables:
- **Consumers** to verify products before purchase.
- **Shop owners** to ensure they source from verified suppliers.
- **Suppliers** to track product distribution and prevent counterfeit infiltration.
- **Regulators** to monitor compliance and conduct audits efficiently.

### 1.4 Individual Scope & Feasibility Justification
#### **Scope**
SpazaSafe will focus on:
- **Product Authentication:** QR code scanning to verify product legitimacy.
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** Tracking product movement from suppliers to Spaza shops.
- **Regulatory Monitoring:** Providing oversight tools for compliance enforcement.
- **User Management:** Enabling roles for consumers, shop owners, suppliers, and regulators.

#### **Feasibility Justification**
- **Technical Feasibility:** The system will use Laravel (PHP) for backend processing, MySQL for data storage, and QR code technology for product verification.
- **Economic Feasibility:** The solution is cost-effective since it leverages widely available mobile technology and cloud hosting.
- **Operational Feasibility:** The system is user-friendly, requiring only a smartphone to scan QR codes, making it easy for shop owners and consumers to adopt.
