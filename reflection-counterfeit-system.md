# Reflection on Domain Model and Class Diagram Design

## Challenges Faced in Designing the Domain Model and Class Diagram

Designing the domain model and class diagram for the counterfeit detection system posed several challenges, particularly in the areas of abstraction, relationships, and method definitions.

### Abstraction
One of the primary challenges was determining the appropriate level of abstraction for the entities. For instance, deciding whether entities like `Alert` and `Report` should be represented as separate classes or combined into a single class required careful consideration. While creating distinct classes allowed for better modularity and specific functionality, it also introduced additional complexity in managing relationships and multiplicity.

Additionally, identifying the boundaries of the `ComplianceDashboard` entity was tricky. It aggregates data from multiple reports and alerts, but its role overlaps with other entities like `User`, which also interact with these components. Striking a balance between over-generalization and under-specification was a key challenge.

### Relationships
Defining relationships between entities was another complex task. For example, the relationship between `Product` and `Alert` was initially modeled as a one-to-one association, but further analysis revealed that a product might not always trigger an alert, leading to the introduction of optional multiplicity (`0..1`). Similarly, determining whether the `ComplianceDashboard` should "own" the alerts and reports via composition, or simply aggregate them via association, required several iterations.

### Method Definitions
Defining the methods for each class was a challenge due to the need for clear alignment with the systemâ€™s functional requirements. For instance, the `verifyAuthenticity()` method in the `Product` class had to encapsulate complex logic while remaining abstract enough to allow implementation flexibility. Similarly, methods like `generateSummary()` in the `ComplianceDashboard` needed to balance simplicity with the ability to handle diverse data inputs.

## Alignment with Previous Assignments

The class diagram aligns closely with previous assignments, including use cases, state diagrams, and requirements. The use cases, such as "Submit a counterfeit report" and "View alerts," directly informed the methods defined in the `User`, `Report`, and `Alert` classes. 

The state transition diagrams provided insights into the lifecycle of key entities like `Report` and `Alert`, which influenced the attributes and methods associated with these classes. For example, the `status` attribute in the `Report` class and its `updateStatus()` method directly map to the state transitions defined in the state diagram.

The functional requirements outlined in earlier assignments, such as the need for users to view active alerts and submit reports, are encapsulated in the relationships and methods defined in the class diagram. This ensures a cohesive design that bridges requirements and implementation.

## Trade-offs Made

### Simplifying Inheritance vs. Composition
One significant trade-off involved simplifying inheritance in favor of composition. For example, instead of creating a hierarchy of user roles (e.g., `Admin`, `Inspector`), the `role` attribute was introduced in the `User` class. This decision simplified the design and reduced the complexity of managing multiple subclasses while still supporting role-specific functionality through conditional logic.

### Aggregation vs. Composition
Another trade-off was choosing aggregation over composition for the relationship between `ComplianceDashboard` and entities like `Alert` and `Report`. Aggregation was preferred to allow greater flexibility in managing these components independently, even though this choice sacrificed some encapsulation.

### Method Granularity
To keep the design manageable, some methods were defined at a higher level of abstraction. For instance, instead of breaking down `generateSummary()` into multiple smaller methods, it was designed as a single method that encapsulates all summary generation logic. This trade-off streamlined the class diagram but may require additional effort during implementation to handle edge cases.

## Lessons Learned

### Importance of Iteration
The design process highlighted the need for iterative refinement. Initial versions of the domain model and class diagram often lacked clarity or failed to address edge cases, requiring multiple revisions. This iterative approach was essential for aligning the design with functional requirements and improving overall coherence.

### Balancing Simplicity and Flexibility
Striking a balance between simplicity and flexibility was a recurring theme. While overly complex designs can be difficult to implement and maintain, oversimplified designs may not adequately capture the system's requirements. The trade-offs made during the design process underscored the importance of evaluating design decisions in the context of the system's goals.

### Alignment with Functional Requirements
Ensuring that the class diagram aligns with use cases, state diagrams, and requirements reinforced the importance of traceability in object-oriented design. Each class, attribute, and method was mapped to a specific requirement or use case, which helped maintain focus and avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Role of Relationships
The process emphasized the significance of clearly defined relationships between entities. Properly modeling associations, aggregations, and compositions not only improved the diagram's clarity but also facilitated better understanding of how the system components interact.

In conclusion, designing the domain model and class diagram for the counterfeit detection system was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It provided valuable insights into object-oriented design principles, trade-offs, and the importance of aligning design artifacts with functional requirements.
